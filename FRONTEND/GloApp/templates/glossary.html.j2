  <tr><th scope="row" width="106">ASAR</th><td> Advanced Synthetic-aperture Radar (Envisat, European Space Agency).</td></tr>
  <tr><th scope="row" width="106">Azimuth</th><td> Distance measured from the early azimuth line to a particular point in the footprint of an imaging radar, in the direction parallel to the flight path of the radar.</td></tr>
  <tr><th scope="row" width="106">Baseline</th><td> In GPS, a vector of coordinate differences between two points or an expression of the coordinates of one point with respect to the other. In common usage, the term often refers to the scalar
    distance between two points rather than to the vector. In InSAR, baseline refers to the perpendicular separation between satellite positions from two image pairs.</td></tr>

    farming, and change in vegetation cover.</td></tr>
