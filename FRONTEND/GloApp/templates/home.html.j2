The Glacial Lake Observatory (GLO) will provide a global database of glacial lakes and bring together key datasets for analysis. Users will be able to collaboratively access and edit the database for their research. Monitoring tools will highlight lake dynamics relevant to stakeholders and disaster risk reduction planning. 

This is a holding page whilst the GLO is developed. We expect the first version will be released in early 2026. The GLO is being developed as part of a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship awarded to C. Scott Watson, University of Leeds. For further information, please contact Dr C. Scott Watson.

<h1>Glacial Lake Observatory</h1>

<b>The Glacial Lake Observatory (GLO)</b> is a collaborative, continuously updated platform that integrates a database and analytics suite for glacial lakes. Its initial focus centers on <b>Nepal and the broader High Mountain Asia region</b>, where rapid environmental change poses urgent challenges for communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. 

GLO brings together key datasets to support research, monitoring, and decision-making. Users can <b>access, contribute to, and refine</b> the database, fostering open science and reproducible workflows. Integrated monitoring tools will track lake dynamics, offering actionable insights for <b>researchers, stakeholders, and disaster risk reduction planners</b>. 

<b>The platform is under development.</b>
